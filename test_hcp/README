The example is HCP lattice with c/a = 1.633 (the ratio which maximise the packing factor)
made of cca 3400 atoms. The structure is like one plane one color, second plane second color, third
plane first color, fourth plane second color, etc. 

- first run the binary one_event22.x with events.in as input: './../one_event22.x < event.in'
  This generates the file 'ordered_events11.dat'

- second you run the binary p22.x, without any input: './../p22.x'
  This writes an output on your screen which is huge (this is a warning!)
  What it does is just three 'steps' with trying to find possible 'events' at each step.
  First stage by comparing the hashes, and then finding the basis.
